### Packet Analyzer project written in Go

This project is a packet analyzer written in Go. It is a simple packet analyzer that can be used to analyze packets from a Wireshark (exported) json file. The initial code
is similar to the REST API projects I did in Node.js and Python. But I do not plan to translate the Node.js or Python code to Go but instead use this as a learning
exercise to learn Go and as a starting point for a more advanced packet analyzer. This will be CLI based instead and will use the Cobra https://cobra.dev/ library to
create the CLI. It's more of a long-term project that I will work on when I have time.
